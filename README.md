# conductor-community
### What happened to this project
Conductor-community was created to maintain the community contributed modules in a separate repository.  
This was done primarily while under the Netflix org to keep maintainance of the project simpler.

With the creation of conductoross, the community modules are part of the main repo (yay!).
All the modules that are part of the conductoross/conductor will be treated as the primary artifacts going forward and continue to be supported/maintained.
